# Insurance Policy Comparison

Given a family profile and the characteristics of several insurance plans, iterate across _n_ randomly generated years of health events and estimate the net cost to the household. Hopefully a tool like this could allow households to choose their insurance plans with something approaching the degree of analytical clarity that insurance companies themselves enjoy.

Additional data about national plans is available [here.](http://www.rwjf.org/en/research-publications/find-rwjf-research/2014/03/breakaway-policy-dataset.html)

This was an R Shiny app, and is being rebuilt as pure JavaScript (in angular). A more-or-less current version of the new app can be found [here.](https://mwfrost.com/insurance_estimator/insurance_angular.html)

*Methodological note:* the analytical method proposed for this project is more complex and probably less robust than the one described [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujPqaE6cVjQ).
